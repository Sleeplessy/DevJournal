<code>
//C programmers:
Type array[upper_bounds];//arrays
for(int i=0;i<upper_bounds;i++){
    //the for loop
}

//C++ programmers:
vector<type> v;//vector
for(auto it=v.begin();it!=v.end();it++){
    //the for loop
}
</code>

If you are a C or a Java programmer,you may prefer < or > while writing loops,and you may be confused about C++ programmers using "!=".So why "!=" is better than those comparison oprators?

Some may guess that,"Hey,we don't have containers like vectors,but C++ has it!".Well,vectors can also use vector[index] to visit elements,so why not? The truth is simple:just the same as why C++ programmers prefer iterator than indexs--this programming style is available to all containers defined in the Standard Libraries.

In additional,although std types like <code>string</code>, <code>vector</code> can vist members using index,but not all containers can.Likely,all standard containers definded == & !=, but most of them don't have a < or a >.It is easy to find the type of a itrator if using !=,but it is not the same if we turns to "<", ">".

And,unified style does no harm,right?:smile:
